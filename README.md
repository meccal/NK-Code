This repository replicates the New Keynesian model (in its basic version of Gali (2015)) with three different methods:
1. Log-linearization
2. Projection method using Chebyshev polynomials and Gauss-Hermite quadrature, with a modified version of Fernandez-Villaverde et al (2015).
3. Perburbation method using Dynare
